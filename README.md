# Vue Task Tracker

## Description
This is a task tracker application built using Vue, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The application allows you to add, delete, and toggle tasks.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: The application allows you to add new tasks with a title and a reminder property.
- **Delete Tasks**: The application allows you to delete tasks.
- **Toggle Reminder**: The application allows you to toggle the reminder status of tasks.
- **Routing**: The application uses React Router to navigate between the main page and the about page.

## How It Works
The application is implemented using functional components and hooks in React. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **App Component**: The App component is the main component of the application. It maintains the state of the tasks and whether the add task form should be shown. It also handles adding, deleting, and toggling tasks, and fetching tasks from the server.
2. **Header Component**: The Header component displays the header of the application and a button to toggle the add task form.
3. **Tasks Component**: The Tasks component renders a list of tasks.
4. **AddTask Component**: The AddTask component renders a form to add a new task.
5. **About Component**: The About component displays some information about the application.
6. **Footer Component**: The Footer component displays a footer with a link to the about page.
